# Real-time-posture-detection
The main goal of this project is to help people check their posture and can be used for healthy exercise 
Technologies Used
The project is built using the following key technologies:

Website Look (Front-End)
HTML: Provides the basic structure and content of the web pages.

CSS (with Bootstrap): Used for styling the website, ensuring a good visual appearance and responsiveness across different devices.

p5.js: A JavaScript library employed for drawing video, keypoints, and skeleton on the screen, likely for visualizing the body pose estimation.

Website's Brains (Back-End & AI)
Node.js & Express.js: These technologies form the back-end framework, helping the website run smoothly and efficiently.

ml5.js: A special JavaScript library for web-based AI, specifically used here for implementing pre-trained AI models for tasks like body pose estimation.

Key Advantage
A significant advantage of this project is its focus on understanding and applying ml5.js and p5.js. These libraries utilize pre-trained AI models, which eliminated the need for us to train our own AI models or clean data. This approach significantly contributed to building the application efficiently.
